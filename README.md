# familyTreeDNA Analysis

[familyTreeDNA](https://www.familytreedna.com), one of those fairly-cheap-family-finder-ethnicity-genotyping services, provides genotype outputs in a csv. 

This repo provides code to convert the csv into a vcf, so I can use my [ethnicity imputation workflow](https://github.com/davemcg/ethnicity_imputation/blob/master/README.md) to get place a sample against the 1000G populations.
